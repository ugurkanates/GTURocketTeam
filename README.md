All avionic software created for Arduino Pro/Pro Mini module.Backup flight computer is Arduino Uno R3
Processor is ATmega328P 3.3V 8Mhz
Telemetry is 3DR 915 Mhz
For video we used FPV Module with 5.8 GHZ Camera. FPV camera can be watched via TFT screen or any EasyCap stick would work 
with PC and view can be seen programs such as VLC or your own program just uses any WebcamView as screen part.

This Repo includes

- Libraries(dependencies) for sensors and other electronic parts. Most of them are taken directly with little to no modifications.
If there is any modifications it should be in readme text file of that sensor folder. Also includes why it was needed to include this
